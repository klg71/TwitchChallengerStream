# TwitchChallengerStream
This Project aims to provide a league streaming experience, for summoners that have no League Client installed on their system or simply enjoy watching high elo gamplay without further commentary.

This project currently uses a fixed list of challenger players from EUW (updated at 25.07.2017) and checks whether someone of this players is playing and if yes collects them into a list.

The viewer can now vote which player they want to see and a few time later the game is spectated and streamd to twitch.
After the game, the project reads out the made votes and starts the next game according to the highest votes.

If i could made it to a Project with this admission, i could make the challenger list dynamic and add even more summoners to have a wider spectrum to draw from.

This application is written in Elixir (I wanted to try something new) and uses currently the Spectator and Match Api to draw data from.
